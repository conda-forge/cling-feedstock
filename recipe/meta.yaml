  summary: Cling - The Interactive C++ Interpreter
  description: Cling is an interactive C++ interpreter, built on top of Clang and
    LLVM compiler infrastructure. Cling realizes the read-eval-print loop (REPL)
    concept, in order to leverage rapid application development. Implemented as
    a small extension to LLVM and Clang, the interpreter reuses their strengths
    such as the praised concise and expressive compiler diagnostics.
